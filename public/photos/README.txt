Drop your local photos in this folder.

How it works now:
- The site will automatically detect images in this folder via /api/photos.
- Supported extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .gif, .avif
- You can add as many as you like; they’ll be sorted by filename (natural order: 1, 2, 10, 11…)

Displayed counts by default:
- Ring: up to 12 photos
- Grid: up to 24 photos
- Marquee: a selection based on what’s available (looped)

Tips:
- Recommended sizes: 1200x1200 or larger, JPG optimized.
- Square images look best in the ring and grid.
- After adding files, refresh the page to see changes.

Optional numbering fallback:
- If no files are present, the code will attempt /photos/1.jpg … /photos/24.jpg as a last resort.
